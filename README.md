# kanye-eda
 tl;dr:  Kanye West's Tweets EDA and sentiment analysis about his bipolar disorder cycle. Kanye is bipolar, and his Twitter account said a lot about his bipolar disorder cycle. He needs therapist.
## Techstacks
- Visualization and tabular analyzing: pandas, matplotlib and seaborn
- NLP: re, nltk, VADER
- Statistical model: statsmodel
- Scraper: snscrape

## Next
I can scale up the project by:
- Find the way to stream the Twitter of Kanye onto a database -> push data into database and pull data from it to use for analyzing, visualizing and building model.
- Use a visualization library (Streamlit, Viola, Panel) or a visualization tool (Tableau, PowerBI) to create dashboard for the bipolar cycle.
- Use other methods to find a way to modeling the time-series data (ARMA, or other naive way), on a same dashboard to compare things.
